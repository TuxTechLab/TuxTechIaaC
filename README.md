## Security

1. As this repo helps to deploy CNCF application on multi-cloud. Hence there is a very urgent requirement of security and secret management.
2. For Security We Want to use GPG signed commits in this repo. Currently still the setup GPG key is facing issues. Will put a documentation on how to setup GPG signed Git Commit for Windows, Mac, Linux environments.
3. Also environment variables/ secrects for running application will be shared using demo secrects. And request anyone who plans to use this solution, to generate/ use their own unique strong password/ secrets. DO NOT USE DEMO ENV SECRETS in Production.
